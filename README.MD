### An experimental fiddling for a procedural fantasy RPG name generator base on the Divina Commedia



This is a project I made mostly as a joke, but I really like to play with this concept so I will further expand this idea in the future.

Currently it is implemented as follows:

- the generator is fed a plain text version of the Divina Commedia by Dante Alighieri, and processes it extracting every syllable according to the rules of the Italian language;

- every syllable is stored in a database along with a few statistics such as frequency and which other syllables it can be connected with;

- every names is generated associating random syllables, but following the statistics gathered from the given text.
